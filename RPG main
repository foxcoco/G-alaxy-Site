		<p1 style="text-align: center"> A kind of video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character<br/> (and/or several party members)immersed in some well-defined world.<br/> Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games<br/>(Including Dungeons & Dragons) and use much of the same terminology,<br/> settings and game mechanics.<br/> Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed <br/>story-telling and narrative elements, player character development,<br/> complexity, as well as replayability and immersion.<br/> The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed.<br/> RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. </p1><br/><br/>

						Action role-playing games are one of the types of video games. It refers to a work that combines elements of action games, role-playing games, and adventure games. Specifically, the basic type is an RPG element that allows the character to continue to take risks, an action process for a battle scene, an adventure game element for solving a hidden puzzle or an organ, and the like. In particular, most of the games that will be able to connect these scenes smoothly are "action role-playing games".

						Also called massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is an online game in which electronic role-playing games are classified according to the number of video game players. In all MMORPGs, the player can play one or more virtual characters and control the character's activities and behaviors in the virtual world of the game. The difference between massively multiplayer online role-playing games and stand-alone games (such as the Warcraft series) and other small, multiplayer role-playing games (such as CS) is that massively multiplayer online role-playing games have a continuous run. In the virtual world, after the player leaves the game, the virtual world continues to exist in the host server provided by the online game operator and continues to evolve until the game is terminated.

						Similar to the original trpg style, focusing on the player's choices and behavior will greatly affect the story. <em>Dragon and Dungeons</em> is the pioneering and masterpiece of this type of rpg game. With the rise of other categories of games, the traditional rpg has gradually declined, and few outstanding works have appeared in recent years. After 2010, only the <em>Pillar of Eternal 2</em> and <em>Divinity 2</em> have more than 8.0 IGN scores.

						The Roguelike type of games was clearly defined at the 2008 International Roguelike Development Conference. Among the naming and definition processes, the more frequently occurring features include:<br/>1. Generate randomness. Each new game will randomly generate game scenes, enemies, treasures and other different things. And every adventure of the player will be unique and cannot be copied.<br/>2. The process is unidirectional. When you are playing a Roguelike game, the only function of the archive function is to record your current game progress. Whenever the archive is read, the corresponding progress is cleared until you make the next archive.<br/>3. Irreducible. In most Roguelike games, each character has only one life, and the death of one character means that the player will lose the character forever.<br/>4. The game is non-linear. The rigorous yet flexible rules of the game give Roguelike a high degree of freedom. In the game, players can use their imagination to use whatever means to achieve whatever they want, or to be reasonable, or incredible. It's just to solve the problems they have encountered in the game.<br/>5. The picture is simple. In fact, Rogue, the originator of Roguelike games, is widely regarded as one of the first graphical games of adventure games, although this "graphical interface" is abstract. However, many Roguelike games, because of their tribute to Rogue, will directly use ASCII characters to represent the game screen, and the protagonists of many games will call the same name, @.<br/>6. system complexity. The complexity of Rogue itself is far more than any of the works of the same period.
